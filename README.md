# IntelliJ IDEA Git QuickView Plugin

This plugin adds an 'Open Git QuickView' option in IntelliJ IDEA that lets you quickly clone a Git repository, open it in a new window, and automatically remove the repository when the project window is closed.

## Features

- **Clone and Open Git Repositories:** Paste a Git repository URL, and the plugin will clone the repository with a depth of 1 and open it in a new IntelliJ IDEA window.
- **Automatic Cleanup:** When you're done with a repository and close the window, the plugin will automatically remove the repository from your computer. This keeps your workspace clean and prevents clutter from building up over time.

## Usage

1. Go to `File > Open for QuickView...`.
2. Paste the URL of a Git repository in the input field.
3. Click `OK`.
