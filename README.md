# IntelliJ IDEA Github Preview Plugin

This plugin adds an 'Open from GitHub' option in IntelliJ IDEA that lets you quickly clone a GitHub repository, open it in a new window, and automatically remove the repository when the project window is closed.

## Features

- **Clone and Open GitHub Repositories:** Paste a GitHub repository URL, and the plugin will clone the repository with a depth of 1 and open it in a new IntelliJ IDEA window.
- **Automatic Cleanup:** When you're done with a repository and close the window, the plugin will automatically remove the repository from your computer. This keeps your workspace clean and prevents clutter from building up over time.

## Usage

1. Go to `File > Open from GitHub...`.
2. Paste the URL of a GitHub repository in the input field.
3. Click `OK`.
